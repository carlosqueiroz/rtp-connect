First public release.
The library, although missing support for a number of record types, should be usable
for people interested in working with RTPConnect files in Ruby. The library features
a complete test suite: In addition to basic unit tests, it has been tested successfully
with a small selection of RTPConnect files, and is believed to be fairly robust.

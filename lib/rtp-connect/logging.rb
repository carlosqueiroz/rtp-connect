module RTP

  # This module handles logging functionality.
  #
  # Logging functionality uses the Standard library's Logger class.
  # To properly handle progname, which inside the RTP module is simply
  # "RTP", in all cases, we use an implementation with a proxy class.
  #
  # @note For more information, please read the Standard library Logger documentation.
  #
  # @example Various logger use cases:
  #   require 'rtp-connect'
  #   include RTP
  #
  #   # Logging to STDOUT with DEBUG level:
  #   RTP.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  #   RTP.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
  #
  #   # Logging to a file:
  #   RTP.logger = Logger.new('my_logfile.log')
  #
  #   # Combine an external logger with RTP:
  #   logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  #   logger.progname = "MY_APP"
  #   RTP.logger = logger
  #   # Now you can call the logger in the following ways:
  #   RTP.logger.info "Message"               # => "RTP: Message"
  #   RTP.logger.info("MY_MODULE) {"Message"} # => "MY_MODULE: Message"
  #   logger.info "Message"                     # => "MY_APP: Message"
  #

      # We use our own ProxyLogger to achieve the features wanted for RTP logging,

      # a custom progname to be used when the logger is called outside the RTP module.
